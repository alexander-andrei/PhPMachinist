Linear Regression: A model that establishes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.

Logistic Regression: A model used for binary classification, estimating the probability of an instance belonging to a certain class.

Decision Trees: Models that make decisions based on a series of rules or conditions, forming a tree-like structure.

Random Forest: An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs): Another ensemble model that combines weak predictive models, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): A model that finds an optimal hyperplane to separate instances of different classes.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that applies Bayes' theorem to make predictions, assuming independence between features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A model that classifies instances based on the class labels of their k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Neural Networks: Deep learning models composed of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Neural network models designed for image processing tasks, utilizing convolutional layers for feature extraction.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Neural network models suitable for sequential data analysis, such as text or time series, as they maintain memory of previous inputs.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining important information.

Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN): Unsupervised learning methods that group similar instances together based on their features.

Hidden Markov Models (HMM): Models used for sequence labeling and prediction tasks, assuming a hidden state that generates observable outputs.
